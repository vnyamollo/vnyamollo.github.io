I'm Vincent Nyamollo, currently a masters student in Industrial and Systems
Engineering at [Lamar University](lamar.edu). 
Prior to this, I have worked in several positions as follows: 
- Research Assistant at [Human Factors and Ergonomics Lab](https://www.lamar.edu/engineering/industrial/research/labs/human-factors-and-ergonomics-laboratory.html) at Lamar University 
supervised by [Yueqing Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ROqVQbMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) working on student learning and discomfort as well as seniors driving behaviors and their relationship with balance issues. 
At the moment I'm working with Chiung-Fang Chang to assess the effects of climate change and air pollution on the residents of South East Texas.  
- Data Analyst at Elara Inc. where I collaborated with operations and marketing teams to drive business growth through data-driven decision-making by analyzing data, automating reporting pipelines and build predictive models and interactive dashboards.
- Project Engineer at [Vivo Energy Kenya](https://www.vivoenergy.com/en/where-we-operate/kenya?tab=retail)
where I led retail automation project rollouts across 100+ sites, coordinating and managing project activities, implementing safety frameworks and communicating with stakeholders.

My research interests encompass the application of Machine Learning for environmental monitoring, with a particular emphasis on leveraging remote sensing and computer vision to better understand and address pressing environmental challenges. Lately, my work has focused on improving air quality prediction in under-monitored regions by integrating satellite-derived atmospheric and meteorological predictors.

Feel free to reach out to me for potential research collaborations.
